# Compiler + Assembler for CS 1810 (formerly CS 1030)

This repo contains tools adapted from versions by Joe Zachary for writing code to run on the "Simple Computer" simulator.

Current versions are all JS that run in a simple web UI.  The compiler was written by Ben Jones based on the design of Peter Marheine who wrote a Rust version.  

The Assembler was written by Minwei Shen and modified by Ben Jones
